# VR Goalkeeper

Welcome to Goalkeeper Game, where you step into the shoes of a goalkeeper with the mission of stopping as many goals as possible. The game offers two exciting modes to test your skills.

### Default Game Mode:

```
Launch the game and experience the default mode, allowing you to place the ball with the "B" button and execute kicks of your prefered speed using the "A" button on the right controller. Take control of the timing of the kicks in a pace that you enjoy.

```
Brace yourself for the ultimate test in the Random Challenge Mode. Face unpredictable scenarios where balls of varying speeds and targets come your way.
